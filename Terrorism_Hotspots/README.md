## Projet description ðŸ“‡

As a security or defense analyst, I analyzed the data and drew conclusions on the distribution and nature of terrorist incidents recorded around the world.

The dataset is an extract from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) - an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
